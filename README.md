# static-resume
This project is a personally crafted and stylish looking static resume. I started this project so that I could make my resume appear exactly the way I want, with beautiful colors and specific fonts to reflect my unique personality. This resume is created with HTML and CSS, with help from the CSS framework Bulma.
